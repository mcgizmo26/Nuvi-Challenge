I created the mock up in React. So you will need to npm install all of the dependencies. I do have a server set up for the  mock endpoints and it also contains the initial axios get request. Most of the controllers contain notes on what they'd theoritically would be used for. 

In the input search bar you can usually bet on someone with "Mr." in it so go ahead and test it out. I created a custom scroll bar to bring up all the names of the "Actors" as well. Click on them to make the data appear. If the user doesn't have a text post then a message stating that it isn't available will appear. 

All of the charts and stats are using the data from the get request.
